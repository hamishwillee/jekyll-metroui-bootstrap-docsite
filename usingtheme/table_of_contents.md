layout: default
title: Table of contents (sidebar)
---

The table of contents in the sidebar can be created using either the MetroUI sidebar or treeview component (only one should be used). The structure of the tree is defined in .yml file in **/_data/metro-sidebar** or **/_data/metro-treeview**. 

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><p>The formats of the two sidebars are similar but inconsistent. I might fix this at some point.</p></div>

The tree used for a page must be set using the page variables ```metrosidebar``` or ```metro-treeview-sidebar```. These can be set for a particular file path in **_config.yml** or within each page.
