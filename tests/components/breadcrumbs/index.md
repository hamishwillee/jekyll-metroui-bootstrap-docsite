title: Breadcrumbs tests 
---

This page (and section) uses the [Metro UI breadcrumbs component](http://metroui.org.ua/buttons.html#_breadcrumbs) to provide a breadcrumb. This is used on the [Treeview test pages](/tests/components/treeview/index.html) only as it has been set up to read the same TOC file as is used in the Treeview component. 

More specifically, if your page uses a treeview sidebar, you'll get the breadcrumb by default.

This does not show the different size breadcrumbs.
