title: Treeview-Sidebar Tests
---

This page (and section) uses the [Metro UI treeview component](http://metroui.org.ua/treeview.html) to provide sidebar navigation.

The component demonstrates:

UP TO HERE _ BELOW NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

* Section headers


The TOC used here is defined in **/_data/metrosidebar/sidebar-toc.yml**. The format to specify the above components is as shown below. Note that the "active" item is determined automatically, as is the name of the item linked by the URL (unless specified)

{% highlight yaml %}


{% endhighlight %}


* There is no way to specify that a dropdown must be open on page load. The implication is that if the page is loaded and the current document is in a dropdown it will not be shown.
